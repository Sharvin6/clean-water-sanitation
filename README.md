- Oversaw the full development cycle, including UI/UX design decisions, task delegation, testing, and final deployment.
- Contributed to implementing major features such as:
    - Real-time Water Scarcity Alerts
    - Interactive Community Impact Dashboard
    - Educational content integration
- Ensured project alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean Water & Sanitation.

# 5. Challenges + Learning

# 6. Outcome
Successfully completed and submitted the H2O Harmony app in APK format for a competition. The app provides users with essential water-related alerts, visual progress dashboards, educational resources, and highlights of local community initiatives. The project strengthened my leadership, Flutter development, and Firebase integration skills.
